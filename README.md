 How Computers Vision Works? – Let’s Harvest Some Tomatoes!

# Introduction

In this episode, we delve into the workings of computer vision—how computers process images and extract meaningful information from them. We explore the intricate process through which computers understand and interpret visual data. Specifically, we focus on the journey of image processing within a computer and the crucial information it leverages to make informed decisions. Additionally, we implemented a Machine Learning model called Support Vector Machine (SVM) for image classification. Our objective? To classify tomatoes!
